Need to figure out a way to add "other" in start form

time lasted all blinds level


Ok so there is a problem with this app and the local database, need to fix that and also add occurance
I dunno what that means above

However we need to add to the database time lasted, all blinds, level


Added a clear button will have to mess around with it later

1/12
add something for each "occurance" ie if it is daily what time, weekly what day, monthly what day (ie last Sunday), bi-yearly, one time. Need to change backend as well
First thing I should do is combine front end and back end
